## Flashcards

The Flashcards tab shows the titles of decks of flashcards and their number of cards in a table view. This is analogous to decks of physical flashcards dedicated to different subjects. The initial screen provides an Edit button that allows the user to delete a deck and an add button (represented with a + symbol, which is familiar for iOS users as this symbol is used throughout the OS) that allows the user to add a new deck.

When the user adds a new deck, the app prompts the user to give it a title. Once the user has typed the title and tapped the Enter button, the app automatically segues into a new view. This is an empty table view, since there are initially no cards in the new deck. This view can also be accessed by tapping on an existing deck from the table view on the first screen. In this view, there is a toolbar with a standard Edit and Add (+) button that allows flashcards to be deleted or added as well as a Rename Deck button that provides an alert with a text field.
